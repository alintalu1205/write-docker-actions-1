[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a powerful platform that empowers your team to go from code to cloud all from the comfort of your own repositories.

Over the duration of this course, approximately 1 hour, you will learn the skills needed to begin using and customizing GitHub Actions in your unique workflow scenarios.

**Prerequisites**

We will be using the GitHub UI to build and consume our actions. Since this is a course on [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) based actions having a basic understanding of Docker is recommended.
