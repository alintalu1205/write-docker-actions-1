1. Add the following contents to the `.github/actions/hello-world/action.yml` file:

       description: "who would you like to greet in the console"
       required: true
       default: "Hubot"

     second-greeting:
       description: "another person to greet"
       required: true
       default: "Mona the Octocat"
