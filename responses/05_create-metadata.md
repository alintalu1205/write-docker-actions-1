## Enough talk, lets do this!

Now that we know what action metadata is, let's create the metadata for our **hello-world** action.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create the metadata file

ðŸ’¡All of the following steps take place inside of the `.github/actions/hello-world` directory.

We will start with using the parameters that are **required** and later implement some optional parameters as our action knowledge grows.

1. Create and add the following contents to the `.github/actions/hello-world/action.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   name: "my hello action"

   description: "say hello with GitHub Actions"

   runs:
     using: "docker"
     image: "Dockerfile"
   ```

2. Commit the changes to a new branch named `hello-world`
3. Click the green `Propose new file` button
